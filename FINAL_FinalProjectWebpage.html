	<p class="text">Our project, Sharp, is a mobile sharps disposal locator. Many people in New York use needles daily-- from diabetics to those undergoing hormone therapy-- and they deserve to have an accessible way to find the nearest needle-disposal location, no matter where they travel in New York.  New York community collection centers alone collected "as many as 2,693,172 syringes [in 2006]" (Klein, 2008). Surprisingly enough, no app currently exists on the market that shows users sharps [aka needles] disposal locations near them! The problem is that it puts the impetus on the user to actively find locations through inefficient methods, through word of mouth, or extensive online browsing between maps and various websites. Also, it is problematic to have sharps as litter, as they can spread infections and diseases if not properly disposed. That's why we want to make it simpler for people to find sharps disposal facilities near them.

	<p class = "text" >
	We are Robin Shum and Anne Cebula, student of the Girls Who Code @ AppNexus Summer Immersion Program. We wanted to build this locator to help ease the process of locating safe disposal places, especially because we are both passionate about solving healthcare-related problems in our community (Robin researched breast cancer prevention last summer, and Anne has frequently observed her mother, an RN). Sharp is the culmination of our research and hard work!

	Our idea is very unique, and there is currently nothing on the app store that does what our locator does. Improperly disposed sharps pose a hazard to others, so we hope to decrease the risk of harm through Sharp. Many individuals in New York State have serious health conditions such as diabetes and use syringes and other sharps for self-treatment at home (source: NYS Department of Health), but they do not have a convenient way to identify disposal facilities near them! The process of at-home administration of syringes generates almost 3 million sharps that need to be disposed, so there is a market for our product. Because people who manage their care at home are preoccupied with their health conditions, the last thing they should be worrying about is finding sharps disposal locations near them! Our sharps disposal facility locator will take the burden off of them by combining a database of addresses with location service features to make finding disposal facilities quick, convenient, and stress-free. With the help of our investors, we together have the ability to fix such an unaddressed health care issue and make an impact on the community around us.
